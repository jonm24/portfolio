Some of my best/most loved tools are: <strong>React.js, Next.js, JQuery, and CSS.</strong><br/><br/>However, I have experience with a multitude of languages and tools such as: <strong>Python, Java, C, Scala, Scheme, SQL, MongoDB, Vercel, REST, GraphQL</strong> and of course <strong>Git.</strong><br/><br/>Aside from my passion for creating user interfaces, I love making tedious internal tasks simple and fast by <strong>automating them/creating internal tools</strong> with my robust knowledge from studying Computer Science."

One quote from my high school football coach that I try to embody in my work is: <strong>"No one is too good to do a dirty job."</strong>'
